# VPN-service

## About the Project
This is a straightforward VPN service designed to resemble a simple website.

**Idea:** Users register on the site and can create a URL that functions as a proxy server. The number of visits to this proxy is then tracked and displayed in the user's personal account.

## How to Run
```bash
make run
make down
make rebuild
```

These instructions provide a clear overview of the project and how to run, shut down, and rebuild it
